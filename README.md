# Notification Service Pub-Sub Architecture Version 1
The project is a notification service with a pub sub architecture to handle message batch of messages by queuing them and showing them one by one.
Good for showing notifications that prefer delays between each notifications.

## Use case:
* When a crowd sourcing site receives money and the name of the donors need to be shown on screen for every transaction then this is a great choice.
* When the youtube user is streaming and the user who joined the stream need to be shown on the screen until it stops then this is a freat choice.
